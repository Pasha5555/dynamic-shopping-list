Run in terminal (root directory):

1. npm i
2. npx json-server db.json (in the first terminal tab)
3. npm run dev (second terminal tab)

For development state management have been used React Context + custom hooks with base state.
Because this app is enough small and I want to show you my experience/skills in this technologies.
Using Redux here will be easier, but it using for larger and scaled projects, so here context + hooks are enough.
For styling were used css modules, but it also can be MUI, tailwind or styled components.

if I had more time I`d like to add loaders and some notifications after actions, and maybe some animations with list.
but I managed to do more than was in the requirements and looking forward to your feedback.
